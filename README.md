ðŸ§© SVG Shape Parser & Normalizer

This project parses SVG files to extract geometric shapes (polygons and paths), scales and normalizes their coordinates, and outputs cleaned data for further use â€” such as nesting algorithms, visualization, or geometric optimization.

## âœ¨ Features

- âœ… Parses `polygon` and `path` elements from SVG
- âœ… Converts shapes into `Vector2`-based vertex lists
- âœ… Supports filtering degenerate or duplicate shapes
- âœ… Scales shapes around their centroids
- âœ… Normalizes all shapes to a [0, N] range (e.g. [0, 1000])
- âœ… Outputs shape data to a clean text file
